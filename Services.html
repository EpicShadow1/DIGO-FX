                            The foreign exchange (also known as forex or FX) market 
                            is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Because of the worldwide reach of trade, commerce, and finance,
                            forex markets tend to be the largest and most liquid asset markets in the world.</li><br>

                    <li>Currencies trade against each other as exchange rate pairs.
                        For example, EUR/USD is a currency pair for trading the euro against the U.S. dollar.</li><br>

                        <li>Forex markets exist as spot (cash) markets as well as derivatives markets,
                            offering forwards, futures, options, and currency swaps.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Market participants use forex to hedge against international currency and interest rate risk,
                                to speculate on geopolitical events, and to diversify portfolios, among other reasons.</li>

                            <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #fcfc; ">WHAT IS FOREX <span> MARKETING</h2></span>
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. 
                            Currencies are important because they allow us to purchase goods and services locally and across borders.
                            International currencies need to be exchanged to conduct foreign trade and business.</p><br>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">If you are living in the United States and want to buy cheese from France, 
                            then either you or the company from which you buy the cheese has to pay the French for the cheese in euros (EUR).
                            This means that the U.S. importer would have to exchange the equivalent value of U.S. dollars (USD) into euros.</p>

                            <p>The same goes for traveling. A French tourist in Egypt can't pay in euros to see the pyramids because it's not the locally accepted currency.
                            The tourist has to exchange the euros for the local currency, in this case the Egyptian pound, at the current exchange rate.</p><br>

                            <h2 style="color:#fcfc; text-align:center">A Brief Hist<span>ory of Forex</h2></span><br>
                            <p>In its most basic sense, the forex market has been around for centuries. People have always exchanged or bartered goods and currencies to purchase goods and services.
                            However, the forex market, as we understand it today, is a relatively modern invention.

                            After the Bretton Woods accord began to collapse in 1971, more currencies were allowed to float freely against one another.
                            The values of individual currencies vary based on demand and circulation and are monitored by foreign exchange trading services.</p>

                            <p>Commercial and investment banks conduct most of the trading in forex markets on behalf of their clients,
                            but there are also speculative opportunities for trading one currency against another for professional and individual investors.</p>
